# atrial-fibrillation (a-fib)

1\. Slow breathing

Slow, focused, abdominal breathing may be enough to relax you and your heart.

Sit quietly and take in a long, slow breath and hold it for a moment before exhaling slowly. Try holding one hand gently but firmly against your diaphragm (around the area of your lower ribs) as you exhale.

You can learn this type of breathing through biofeedback training. Biofeedback is a type of therapy in which you use electronic monitoring of some of the body’s involuntary functions, such as heart rate, to train yourself to have voluntary control over those functions.

Among other techniques, biofeedback involves:

   focused breathing  
   visualization  
   muscle control  
  
2\. Vagal maneuvers

For some people who have paroxysmal AFib, certain maneuvers may help slow down your heart rate or help you cope with the symptoms of atrial fibrillation better. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is a type of AFib in which episodes usually resolve within a few days.

Other techniques that can affect the heart’s electrical system include coughing and bearing down as though you’re having a bowel movement.

These are called vagal maneuvers because they’re designed to trigger a response in the vagus nerve, a major nerve that affects your heart function and releases chemicals that can slow down your heart rate.

Vagal maneuvers may not be safe or appropriate for everyone with AFib, so be sure to discuss this with your doctor.

3\. Yoga

If you’re in the middle of an AFib episode, a little gentle yoga may help settle your heart down. Even if it can’t stop an episode that’s already started, yoga may help reduce the frequency of episodes in general.

A 2015 studyTrusted Source found that people with AFib who took antiarrhythmic medications and went through yoga training achieved significant reductions in blood pressure and heart rate and symptomatic episodes of AFib. They did this while also achieving a better quality of life.

4\. Exercise

If you’re an athlete dealing with AFib, you may find symptom relief by exercising. In a case study from 2002, a 45-year-old athlete with paroxysmal AFib was successful at halting AFib episodes by working out on an elliptical machine or a cross-country skiing machine.

While certain exercises may help stop an AFib episode, you shouldn’t try this approach without first consulting your doctor, as exercise can also sometimes trigger AFib episodes.  
Preventing an AFib episode

The best way to stop an AFib episode is to prevent one from happening in the first place. You can reduce your odds of having an AFib episode in two ways: maintaining good heart health and avoiding AFib triggers.  
Avoiding triggers

If you already have AFib, you might have discovered that certain behaviors can trigger an episode. Binge-drinking alcohol is one. Even a highly caffeinated energy drink can be a problem. Other common triggers include stress and poor sleep or obstructive sleep apnea.

Pay attention to your triggers and talk with your doctor about lifestyle changes you should make to help keep AFib episodes at bay.  
Maintaining your heart health

It’s not always clear why people develop AFib. You may have a condition called lone atrial fibrillation, in which you have no other heart-related health problems. In these cases, it’s difficult to pin down a specific cause of your AFib.

But many people with AFib have a history of conditions related to heart health, including:

   coronary artery disease  
   heart attack  
   hypertension (high blood pressure)  
   valve disease  
   heart failure

You may be able to keep your heart pumping smoothly for a long time if you:

   manage your blood pressure  
   manage your cholesterol levels  
   eat a heart-healthy diet  
   exercise for 20 minutes most days of the week  
   quit smoking if you smoke  
   maintain a healthy weight  
   get enough sleep  
   drink alcohol in moderation  
   reduce stress in your life

Talk with your doctor about what else you can do to maintain or improve your heart health.
